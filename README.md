# Interactive Story Generation

The work in this project has been done by me as my M.Tech Project from IIT Bhubaneswar.

Author: [Sai Krishna Jupally](https://mintu.dev)


The files in the repo contain:
1. Dataset files
2. Dataset formatter code files for custom use
3. Loss Plot code files with output cells containing GPT2 finetuned model plots

### For unsloth models finetuning:
Sample code can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/167cf_6sv9qtc_1PHDKD01JxnCZrqSqtV?usp=sharing)

### Finetuned models:
Finetuned models (and dataset) can be found at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/mintujupally/interactive-story-generation-66328ee530fcf1ce990bc0a8)

### Sample stories:
Sample stories from finetuned models can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SnR4dg7VcQhnvEVm_MkLeHT3SnLvtp89LAehfVeFPos/edit?usp=sharing)

### Interactive Story Generator:
This [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VGTCFM8lKyqXBSKERLP2Wc2EZ-oMb35Q?usp=sharing) contains code for:
1. Loading models for inference
2. Interactive Story Generation
3. 150 stories generator by self-feeding lines to the model

### Compare models - using Entity based Local Coherence 
Code for coherence computation and model comparison available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WfqzvOFkN-pW3ax62AZXO9yxt1Gbu4qZ?usp=sharing)
